Hello everyone, this documentation will guide you through the project, explain the outline and purpose of the project.
It will help you to understand in a simpler way.

    The main purpose of the project is to recruit employees for a company. But these employees have departments while they are being registered.
so that we can list the employees according to the departments or according to the raise rates in the departments.
Let's make a raise.

---------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------
---------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------

    Specific requests within the project are as follows:


    1- Each department should have its own raise rate.

        1.1- A raise should be made only to those who work in the amount of the raise rate. --

        For example: A person named A works in the Information Technologies department and his salary is 10,000,
A person named B works in the Human Resources department and his salary is 10,000. Raise the Human Resources department
Let's assume that the salary rate is 20% and the salary rate in the Information Technologies department is 25%. For people A and B
When a raise is made only once, Person A's salary of 10,000 should be 12500, while Person B's salary should be 12000.

        1.2- The raise rate should not be changed, but it should be accessible so that you can use the rate for the method to be raised.

        1.3- The raise should be made by taking the id of the employee.

        1.4- The raise rate should be fixed and for each person working in a department, the raise rate of that department
        should be valid.

  2- Each employee must have their own unique ID.

          2.1- In order to distinguish between employees, each user must have a unique ID. For example:
  Let us have 2 employees and let these 2 employees be called F覺rat Y覺lmaz. Both work in the same departments, but only
  let someone get a raise. In this case, we have to choose between two identical names. These two names
  The distinguishing feature should be the employee's ID. The ID should be defined in the project as follows.

              Department Code (Human Resources Department -> IKD) +
              (Number of employees in the company + 1) +
              The initials of the employee's full name

              For example: There are 257 employees in the company, Caglar K覺z覺lbulut will be registered in the IT technology department,
              For ages, the ID should be 'BTD258CKt'.

          2.2- Specific operations should be possible through the employee's ID. For example: if an employee is to be given a raise,
          ID must be requested, if an employee is to be deleted, their ID must be requested.


      3- It should be possible to reach the employees through the department.

          3.1- For example: There should be a feature to list only the employees in the "x" department.


      4- While the employees are being printed on the console, only the Employee's ID, Name, Surname, Salary, and Department name should be included.

      For example: "Civil ID: 'BTD1NA', Name: 'Nazmiye Akdogan', Salary: '25000', Department: 'Informatics Technologies Department'"

      (Hint: It can be done easily with the toString() method.)
